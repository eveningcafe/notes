title: Alertmanager Time of day based routing/notification

## 1. Upstream Issue

https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/issues/876

## 2. Solutions

### 2.1. Prometheus record rules and Alertmanager inhibit rules

- Create record rules to define the holidays (timezone aware), then create inhibit rules based on them or just provide them in alert rules.

```yaml
# Use record -> vector + on()
- record: business_day
  expr: |
    vector(1) and day_of_week(belgium_localtime) > 0
    and day_of_week(belgium_localtime) < 6
    unless count(public_holiday)
```

### 2.2. External exporters

- Use external exporters to calculate holidays/desired times..., expose them as metrics. Then we can use them in the alert rules.

### 2.3. Alertmanager time-based muting

- Design: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pf-rPDQUGJUHazyr5vanTO6ft3loNZO9UoVpvhShFtA/edit
- Goal: for Alertmanager to support user-defined time intervals and integrate them into the routing tree, allowing users to model their time-based requirements.
- Implementation: https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/pull/2393
